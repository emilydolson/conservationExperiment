# This is the setup file for the task/resource system.  From here, you can
# setup the available resources (including their inflow and outflow rates) as
# well as the reactions that the organisms can trigger by performing tasks.
#
# This environmental setup is that of a chemostat with 9 resources, each
# with a unique task corresponding to them.  All resources have a set inflow
# of 100, and outflow rate of 0.01, setting their an equilibrium level at
# 10,000.  Given a maximum population size of 3600 and neighborhood size of
# 9, the fraction of the resource absorbable in each reaction is simply
# 9/3600 or 0.0025.
#
# The "safe" cell resource denotes locations in the world where organisms
# are safe from resource dependent kill events
#
# For information on how to use this file, see:  doc/environment.html
# For other sample environments, see:  source/support/config/
